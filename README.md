# Haskell
A messing-about with haskell

# Disclaimer
This is my first time ever touching haskell or functional programming. This is purely a learning experience, and code will appear very messy as I slowly learn the better ways to accomplish tasks with new tools.

# Current goals
Currently attempting to solve a number of [Euler problems](https://projecteuler.net/) with Haskell, in order to learn a little bit about syntax of Haskell.
